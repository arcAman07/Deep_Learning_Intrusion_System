Short Description  
The UNB ISCX IDS 2012 dataset consists of labeled network traces, including full packet payloads in pcap format.
Long Description  
To simulate user behaviour, the behaviours of our Center's users were abstracted into profiles. Agents were then programmed to execute them, effectively mimicking user activity. Attack scenarios were then designed and executed to express real-world cases of malicious behaviour. They were applied in real-time from physical devices via human assistance; therefore, avoiding any unintended characteristics of post-merging network attacks with real-time background traffic. The resulting arrangement has the obvious benefit of allowing the network traces to be labeled. This is believed to simplify the evaluation of intrusion detection systems and provide more realistic and comprehensive benchmarks.

The UNB ISCX 2012 intrusion detection evaluation dataset consists of the following 7 days of network activity (normal and malicious):
